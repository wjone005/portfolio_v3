Well hello there! My name is Willie and I'm a Programmer/Analyst III at [Los Angeles Ethics Commission](https://ethics.lacity.org) and a contractor web developer at [WHJESP](http://whjsc.org/). Before now, I worked at AIG, Freedmaxick CPA's, Caplugs, Wednt Corporation, and graduated from SUNY Buffalo State in 2015.

In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have seen me in [The Record](https://buffstaterecord.com/6278/culture/alum-helps-students-find-jobs-with-new-website/) or the [The Buffalo News](https://buffalonews.com/2015/11/18/on-the-record-nov-19-2015/) a few years back. I created a job board for Western New York. If you like to get know me more, feel free to [email me](mailto:williejones005@gmail.com)!

In my spare time I love playing video games, sports, traveling, enhancing my coding skills and being a big foodie.
